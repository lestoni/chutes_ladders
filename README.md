## Chutes and Ladders

1. Git clone
2. To run algorithms and see some stats

```sh
 $ npm start
```

#### Questions

1) **Is it solvable**?
Given the above representation of a board come up with an algorithm to determine
if a board is solveable (i.e. the game can be won).
How many boards in `chutes_and_ladders.txt` are unsolvable? `10000`

2) **Minimum Number of Rolls**
The minimum number of rolls required to win given the board represented above is 7.
What is the sum of the minimum number of rolls required to win on each solvable
board in `chutes_and_ladders.txt`? `13.8`

3) **Expected Number of Rolls to Win**
The average number of rolls needed to win in the board above is about 39.2 --
What is sum of the average number of rolls needed to win each solvable board in
`chutes_and_ladders.txt` ? `27.5`

4) **Cheating**
If you were playing using the board pictured above and given the opportunity to
weight your die -- how would you decide to weight it to give yourself the best
chance of winning? How much better is your weighting compared to a fairly weighted die? - `N/A`
